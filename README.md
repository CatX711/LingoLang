<h2>Hello World!</h2>

<br />
<br />
Hello world. Welcome to this new programming language book! Well, technically this should be more of the "Official Docs", but did you see how many words GreetLang+ got to? Yeah, 2000 words is pretty much a book.
<br />
I've been yearning to get back into the programming world recently, but I haven't really known how. The thing is, I've been doing a lot of writing. So... okay, I get it, just let me have some fun ;) 

<br />
<br />
<br />

According to feedback the GreetLang+ book was a lot more verbose, containing long and drawn out explinations for most of it's features. But I can't lie, that was the point. That book was a way to test my programming + writing skills and imagination. It was assuming you were a beginner, which most of the people in my family and friend group are. However, due to the lack of interest in programming, and quite frankly, the humongous size of it, I'm guessing around 4 people only ever saw it. Me, my dad, my mum, and perhaps some random coder browsing the interwebs.

<br />
<br />

This, however, aims to be more concise, and just for me or any other developers who find my work impressive to read without the 2000 word's worth of detail.

<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>

<br />
<br />

<p>Lingo is a server side language built to be easier to understand than HTML. It has a simple syntax, easy to learn concepts, and a beginner friendly UI.</p> <br />

Let's start with printing a simple `Hello there!`. This will send out a request to the server to output our text into the terminal. Keep in mind that we are not currently on any website.


<br />
<br />

```JS
--Req("Hello there!")
``` 

<br />
<br />

By using `--Req` we make a request. Isn't that convenient? <br />
And if you want your terminal to look very pretty, you can still use the styling tags like <h1> from HTML that are normally restricted for the website code. <br />
That means your terminal could end up looking like this when you run your program, if you so wish:
