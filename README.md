<h2>Hello World!</h2>

<br />
<br />
Hello there. Welcome to this new programming language book! Well, technically this should be more of the "Official Docs", but did you see how many words GreetLang+ got to? Yeah, 2000 words is pretty much a book.
<br />
I've been yearning to get back into the programming world recently, but I haven't really known how. The thing is, I've been doing a lot of writing. So... okay, I get it, just let me have some fun ;)
