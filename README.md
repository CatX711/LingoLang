<h2>Hello World!</h2>

<br />
<br />
Hello world. Welcome to this new programming language book! Well, technically this should be more of the "Official Docs", but did you see how many words GreetLang+ got to? Yeah, 2000 words is pretty much a book.
<br />
I've been yearning to get back into the programming world recently, but I haven't really known how. The thing is, I've been doing a lot of writing. So... okay, I get it, just let me have some fun ;) 

<br />
<br />
<br />

According to feedback the GreetLang+ book was a lot more verbose, containing long and drawn out explinations for most of it's features. But I can't lie, that was the point. That book was a way to test my programming + writing skills and imagination. It was assuming you were a beginner, which most of the people in my family and friend group are. However, due to the lack of interest in programming, and quite frankly, the humongous size of it, I'm guessing around 4 people only ever saw it. Me, my dad, my mum, and perhaps some random coder browsing the interwebs.

<br />
<br />

This, however, aims to be more concise, and just for me or any other developers who find my work impressive to read without the 2000 word's worth of detail.

<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>

<br />
<br />

<p>Lingo is a server side language built to be easier to understand than HTML. It has a simple syntax, easy to learn concepts, and a beginner friendly UI.</p> <br />

Let's start with printing a simple `Hello there!`. This will send out a request to the server to output our text into the terminal. Keep in mind that we are not currently on any website.


<br />
<br />

```JS
--Req("Hello there!")
``` 

<br />
<br />

By using `--Req` we make a request. Isn't that convenient? <br />
<p>And if you want your terminal to look very pretty, you can still use the styling tags like <h> from HTML that are normally restricted for the website code. <br />
That means your terminal could end up looking like this when you run your program, if you so wish: </p>

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

Let's go over styling, shall we?


<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>Styling</h2>

<br />
<br />

So, how do we style our terminal text? <br />
While using `--Req` we can define size, font, colour, etc.

<br />

```JS
--Req(size=2, font=Comic_Sans, colour=Brilliant_Blue, "I love pizza!")
```

<br />
<br />

You can see here how we define size, font and colour all in one Req! No need for extra lines, just plain old simplicity. `Note: seperate different things you want to alter with a comma: ,   and when changing the size, font or colour, never use spaces, substitute them with underscores: _`

<br />

Keep in mind, instead of having independant header tags for the terminal, the only method of changing the size of a string is the `size` variable within the Req function. For less confusion and time spent refreshing your website every time you change the `size=`, instead you will have a version of <h> tags from HTML, but only when working with code for a website. So, `size` is for terminal strings only. Got it?

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>Website Building</h2>

<br />
<br />

Now we get on to the juicy stuff. Website building is a lot easier than you expect with Lingo. <br />
First, secure a domain, with it's own IP address. `E.g 184.212.251.94`

<br />

Open up a fresh Lingo-gram (Lingo Program/File) and write the following:

<br />
<br />

```JS
--domainIp = 184.212.251.94
```

Great! You've just told your server what website it has to contact. <br />

```JS
--domainIp = 184.212.251.94
--tabName = My Lovely Website
```

<br />

`tabName` is what you want to be displayed on your website's tab. E.g the name on the tab you're on right now is: `CatX711/Lingolang/Ah yes, another adition to the multitude of pointless creations I own. ` Or ``
